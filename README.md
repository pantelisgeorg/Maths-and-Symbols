Calculus symbols explained with examples in English and Greek language.

The symbol images are SVGs (like Wikipedia/MathJax renders). Each card has a simple meaning and an example you can do with just algebra.

There is a Search Box

There are cards for each symbol with a simple explanation i.e:

A limit asks: what value does an expression get close to as x gets close to some number?

Example (just algebra):

lim_{x→2} (x^2 − 4)/(x − 2)

Factor: x^2 − 4 = (x−2)(x+2)

So (x^2 − 4)/(x − 2) = x + 2 (for x ≠ 2)

Now plug in x = 2: the limit is 4.
