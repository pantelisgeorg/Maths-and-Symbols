Calculus symbols explained with examples in English and Greek language.
The symbol images are SVGs (like Wikipedia/MathJax renders). Each card has a simple meaning and an example you can do with just algebra.
There is a Search Box
There are cards for each symbol with a simple explanation i.e:
A limit asks: what value does an expression get close to as x gets close to some number?
Example (just algebra):
lim_{x→2} (x^2 − 4)/(x − 2)
Factor: x^2 − 4 = (x−2)(x+2)
So (x^2 − 4)/(x − 2) = x + 2 (for x ≠ 2)
Now plug in x = 2: the limit is 4.
